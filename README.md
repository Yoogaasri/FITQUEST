Major Project: FitQuest

One of the highlights of my internship was the development of FitQuest, a comprehensive fitness website. This project involved creating multiple sections, including:

	•	Navigation Bar
	•	Home Page
	•	About Page
	•	Services Page
	•	Packages Page
	•	Contact Page

Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to design and implement a fully functional and user-friendly website.

Minor Projects

In addition to the major project, I worked on several minor tasks that contributed to my growth as a web developer.
